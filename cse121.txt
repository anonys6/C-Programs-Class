Hello\n
there,
My
name
is
Md
Shakib
Alam,
and
I
am
currently
pursuing
a
Bachelor's
degree
in
Computer
Science
and
Engineering
at
Lovely
Professional
University
while
also
freelancing
as
a
front-end
web
developer.
I
am
originally
from
Jharkhand,
and
I

my
schooling
at
Model
School
Udhwa,
followed
by
ISc
with
PCM
from
Pakur
Raj+2
High
School
in
Pakur.
Later,
I
worked
as
a
front-end
web
developer
in
New
Delhi
for
a
digital
marketing
company
where
I
gained
experience
in
creating,
deploying,
and
managing
websites
using
languages
such
as
HTML,
CSS,
JavaScript,
and
various
frameworks
including
SASS,
jQuery,
and
React.
I
used
Visual
Studio
Code
as
a
code
editor
and
Google
Chrome
as
a
browser
while
working
on
these
projects.

When
it
comes
to
my
interests,
I
enjoy
learning
new
technologies,
languages,
and
frameworks,

videos
related

physics.
I

am
proficient
in
programming
languages

and

as
well

and
SQL.
I
am
familiar
with
frameworks
such

SASS
and
jQuery,
and
my
go-to
language
is
C++
due
to
its
support
for
both
object-oriented
and
protocol-oriented
programming.
While
I
primarily
use
Windows
as
my
operating
system,
I
also
have
experience

editing,

illustrations,

Filmora
X

video
editing.
Additionally,
I

per
minute.

As
an
ambivert,
I
